#Order Service
This is a very contrived example so I can experiment with reactive, kotlin, parallel
calls from the composite to multiple services, and whatever else I can think of

#Things To Research
1. Kradle (kotlin version of gradle)
2. Spek/whatever other native kotlin frameworks for testing (vs spock)
3. security using jwts and webflux
4. entities vs models(dtos) pass entites outside?
5. kotlin package vs module vs class vs stuff in a file?
